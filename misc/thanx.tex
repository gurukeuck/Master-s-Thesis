First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor Martin Rudorfer for his constant flow of helpful ideas, high responsiveness and willingness to take time to support me.. It sums up to 15 hours of face to face meetings, 1.5 hours of video calls, 42 e-mails and unknown time for proofreading.\\ \\
\noindent
To my colleagues, namely Wilma, Marian and Nils: Thank you for being so cooperative. You made working full time and writing a master's thesis possible!\\ \\
\noindent
Last but not least, I would like to thank my family and friends who accompanied me over the years of my studies:\\ \\

\textbf{Thank you!}
