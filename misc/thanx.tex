First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor Martin Rudorfer for his constant flow of helpful ideas, high responsiveness and taking his time for all support. It sums up to 15 hours of face to face meetings, 1.5 hours of video calls, 42 E-Mails and unknown time for proofreading.\\ \\
\noindent
To my employers, namely Wilma, Marian and Nils: Thank you for being so cooperative. You made working full time and writing a master's thesis possible!\\ \\
\noindent
To all proofreaders, who found countless mistakes in structure, layout, grammar and content: You make this thesis so much more readable, big shout-outs to you!\\ \\
\noindent
Last but not least, I would like to thank my family and friends who accompanied me over the years of my studies which now come to a successful end:\\ \\

\textbf{Thank you!}
