\section{Evaluation Parameters}
As opposed to monolithic applications SOAs are highly agile and easily integrated into distributed systems. This hypothesis has to be supported by qualitative and quantitative test results. An example for a qualitative test would be a test center where the same OD algorithm has to be integrated into a SOA and a monolithic application. The integration should be executed by several equally skilled groups of which one half starts with SOA and the other with monolithic application.

Quantitative parameters could be the size of the service containers, the CPU and RAM load they utilize. The usability of the service is also of high impartance, e.g. the number of protocols that the interface offers, the documentation of the interface etc.

\section{An Example Case Study}
		\subsection{Assumptions}
			\subsubsection{Before: monolithic system, was in use for 15 years}
			\subsubsection{Now: Change to my system, then change/test of ODM shall happen}
		\subsection{Time / Cost for stakeholders}
			\subsubsection{Detector Image Providers}
			\subsubsection{Camera Image Providers}

            In case the port has to be changed it is necessary to change it in three locations - dockerfile, gRPC client and gRPC server.
